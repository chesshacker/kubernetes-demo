# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App][cra].

[Here][cra-guide] you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.

## Development

You may find it helpful to develop the frontend separately. By default, it looks
for the API urls on the same server. However, you can override this by setting
the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` environment variable when you start the dev server,
like so:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://192.168.64.8:32567 npm start
```
